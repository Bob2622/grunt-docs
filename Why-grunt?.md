Grunt is a task-based command line build tool written in JavaScript.

It’s far too easy to create a gist or one-file repository and promise yourself that you’ll add linting and unit tests later. 

Also as seen, doing all this stuff manually is a total pain, and building all this stuff into a gigantic Makefile / Jakefile / Cakefile / Rakefile / ?akefile that's maintained across all projects was also becoming a total pain. Since I always found myself performing the same tasks over and over again, for every project, it made sense to build a task-based build tool.


With grunt, all the excuses you've ever made just disappear. Instead of being a chore, creating a new project and performing repetitive but necessary tasks such as linting, unit testing, concatenating and minifying files become trivially easy.

( Just structuring, will need to flesh out more )

## How do i get started?
To get started, take a look at the [getting started guide](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/wiki/Getting-started), which is a generic guide to configuring grunt for your project. In addition, check out the example Gruntfiles() which highlight a number of fairly common configurations.
