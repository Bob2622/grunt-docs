It’s far too easy to create a gist or one-file repository and promise yourself that you’ll add linting and unit tests later. 

As seen doing all this stuff manually is a total pain, and building all this stuff into a gigantic Makefile / Jakefile / Cakefile / Rakefile / ?akefile that's maintained across all projects was also becoming a total pain. Since I always found myself performing the same tasks over and over again, for every project, it made sense to build a task-based build tool.

With grunt, all the excuses you’ve ever made just disappear. Instead of being a chore, creating a new project and performing repetitive but necessary tasks such as linting, unit testing, concatenating and minifying files become trivially easy.
