## grunt-cli
This is the npm package you install globally.  The grunt binary no longer ships with grunt itself.  Consequently, globally installing grunt does nothing.  This decouples the grunt command from grunt itself.  The CLI can now be thought of as a wrapper that does nothing but abstract away the manual process of configuring and running grunt.  Hopefully this helps clear up the global installation confusion.

**This module does the following:**

1. Processes CLI params and exports a configuration object when required.
2. Provides a global `grunt` command which:
  - Requires the CLI processor, producing the configuration object.
  - Looks for a local grunt and requires it.
  - Creates an instance of the required grunt, passing in the configuration. (this configures logging verbosity, what commands will eventually be run, etc).
  - Looks for a Gruntfile and requires that, passing in the instance of grunt (the Gruntfile does it's normal thing, further modifying the instance of grunt, adding tasks, etc).
  - Calls `run` on the grunt instance, executing the configuration specified at the CLI.
