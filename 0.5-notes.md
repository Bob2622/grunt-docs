527 - parallel execution of tasks
545 - conditional compilation (probably belongs on the watch task)
493 - cwd handling

## grunt
* should abort early if no files defined, if a flag like needsFiles is set to true when exporting task
* should give config to task with files expanded, allow custom expansion if desired
* Investigate shelljs integration. [#59](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/issues/59)
* more specific error codes
  * Task not found
  * Task failed
  * Task requirement not met
  * Config requirement not met

## grunt-log
* Log to stderr/stdout. #570 [#120](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/issues/120)
* https://github.com/tkellen/grunt-decoupled/tree/master/grunt-log

## grunt-file
* https://github.com/tkellen/grunt-decoupled/tree/master/grunt-file

## grunt-util
* https://github.com/tkellen/grunt-decoupled/tree/master/grunt-util

## grunt-task
* Task loading should be more robust.  Allow it to load from a single tasks file, a directory of tasks files, or a passed-in callback. [#261](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/issues/261)
* Task testability: [#183](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/issues/183)
* Task API: [#189](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/issues/189), [#385](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/issues/385)
* Make a convention for what happens when files for a task are missing [#434](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/issues/434)
* anonymous task names
