# Introducing v0.4
As of this morning, Grunt v0.4 final is available on npm!  For a lengthy writeup on the release, [please see my article on the Bocoup blog](http://bocoup.com).

### The Broad Strokes

1. Grunt no longer ships with built in tasks.  They've been extracted into officially maintained, standalone plugins under the grunt-contrib namespace.  See the [plugin listing](http://gruntjs.com/plugins) on our website for more details. 

2. Grunt no longer ships with a binary. In order to get the `grunt` command, install [grunt-cli](http://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-cli) globally with `npm install -g grunt-cli`. This package will run any version of Grunt (including 0.3x) when it's been installed locally to your project.

3. Options can now be defined at the task level under the `options` key, and they'll automatically apply for all of your targets. If needed, you can override some or all of them. [Check out our documentation for more details.](http://gruntjs.com/Configuring-tasks#options)

4. New [task configuration modes](http://gruntjs.com/configuring-tasks), including 1-to-1 mapping for passing an entire directory of files through a task and depositing them into another while maintaining the structure. [Check out our documentation for more details.](http://gruntjs.com/configuring-tasks#building-the-files-object-dynamically)

5. Tons of [new conveinence apis](http://gruntjs.com/api/grunt).

### Looking Ahead

1. Grunt makes it easy to select, negate and map your project files from one location to another without complicated globbing patterns. Soon, we'll be extracting this system into a standalone library anyone can use.

2. Our templating configuration system makes sharing values in complex configurations a cinch.  We're turning that into a consumable npm package as well.

3. Grunt v0.5 will ship with support for a new plugin format called [node-task](http://github.com/tkellen/node-task). It defines a stateless, promise-based, event emitting API that doesn't depend on Grunt. It has a real-live spec, and the Grunt team is working with the front-end developer community in the hopes that compliant modules will be compatible with every task runner under the sun.
