## grunt-init
Grunt-init is a scaffolding tool used to automate project creation. It will build an entire directory structure based on the current environment and the answers to a few questions. The exact files and contents created depend on the template chosen along with the answers to the questions asked.

_Note: This standalone utility used to be built-in to grunt as the "init" task. See the grunt [Upgrading from 0.3 to 0.4](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/wiki/Upgrading-from-0.3-to-0.4) guide for more information about this change._

For more information, see the [grunt-init documentation](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-init).
