## Grunt: The JavaScript Task Runner

_WORK IN PROGRESS_

Here are some of the benefits of using grunt:

### Gruntfiles are completely defined in standard JavaScript or CoffeeScript.
No XML, no custom syntax.

### Configuration is declarative.
Since the `Gruntfile` is JavaScript, the grunt API can be used to dynamically build the configuration.

### A collection of officially-maintained "contrib" plugins exists to help you get started.
The most common tasks, like concatenating and minifying files, linting code, running unit tests, etc have already been created.

### Creating custom tasks and Grunt plugins is easy.
Full documentation and API reference are available.

### A large community of developers creating common tasks.
