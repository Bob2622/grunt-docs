Do you use Grunt in your projects and want to proudly display that in your project Readme on Github?

That's why we had our very own [Isaac Durazo](http://github.com/isaacdurazo) make a Grunt mini-badge that you can add to your Readme file. If you are using the Travis mini-badges ours fits nicely next to it.

[![Travis Ci Build Passing](http://gruntjs.com/img/travis-badge.png)](http://travisci.org) [![Built with Grunt](https://cdn.gruntjs.com/builtwith.png)](http://gruntjs.com/)

Just copy and paste the following code snippet and place it right underneath the headline in your Readme:

Let us know if you are using it on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/gruntjs) or on IRC in the #grunt channel.
