## grunt-cli
* Define new cli options? [#488](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/issues/488)

This is the npm package you install globally.  The grunt bin no longer ships with grunt itself.  Consequently, globally installing grunt does nothing.  This decouples the grunt command from grunt itself.  The CLI can now be thought of as a wrapper only abstracts away the manual process of configuring and running grunt. Hopefully this helps clear up the global installation confusion.  Once grunt-init is gone, this package will have no dependencies, it's just a script to fire up grunt.

**This module does the following:**

1. Processes CLI params and exports a configuration object when required.
2. Provides a global `grunt` command which:
  - Requires the CLI processor, producing the configuration object.
  - Looks for a local grunt and requires it.
  - Creates an instance of the required grunt, passing in the configuration. (this configures logging verbosity, what commands will eventually be run, etc).
  - Looks for a Gruntfile and requires that, passing in the instance of grunt (the Gruntfile does it's normal thing, further modifying the instance of grunt, adding tasks, etc).
  - Calls `run` on the grunt instance, executing the configuration specified at the CLI.

## grunt
* should abort early if no files defined, if a flag like needsFiles is set to true when exporting task
* should give config to task with files expanded, allow custom expansion if desired
* Investigate shelljs integration. [#59](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/issues/59)
* more specific error codes
  * Task not found
  * Task failed
  * Task requirement not met
  * Config requirement not met

## grunt-log
* Log to stderr/stdout. [#120](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/issues/120)
* https://github.com/tkellen/grunt-decoupled/tree/master/grunt-log

## grunt-file
* https://github.com/tkellen/grunt-decoupled/tree/master/grunt-file

## grunt-util
* https://github.com/tkellen/grunt-decoupled/tree/master/grunt-util

## grunt-task
* Task loading should be more robust.  Allow it to load from a single tasks file, a directory of tasks files, or a passed-in callback. [#261](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/issues/261)
* Task testability: [#183](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/issues/183)
* Task API: [#189](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/issues/189), [#385](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/issues/385)
* Make a convention for what happens when files for a task are missing [#434](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/issues/434)
* anonymous task names
